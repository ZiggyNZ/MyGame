Model:
    - Separate tiles and entities into layers
    - Layers should return a single image containing all images on that layer
        - When image get request is made, check for a change to layer. If change is made then update layers image
        - Draw order:
            - First: Floor
            - Second: Selection rings and pathing
            - Third: Entities

    - Note that variable 'tresspassable' has become obstruction and the equivalent value is inverted

TODO: make terrain not an entity. Consider making the obstruction variable an image path (string)
