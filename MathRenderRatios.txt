These values are based off the current 43 x 86 hexagons

X VALUES:
Each step the x value must increase by a percentage of the tile's width (148%). This is essentially the distance between each x node.
    x increase = 1 tile + (distance between two top corners - 1)
       = (42 + 86) / 86 = 1.48837209302
Every second tile on the y axis must be drawn more to the right by a percentage of the tile's width (74.58%).
    x increase = (x value of top right corner) / (total width)
        = 65 / 86 = 0.75581395348
    NOTE: 0.74581395348 May need to be used when zooming in
Since the number of pixels on the x axis = (number of x tiles) * (148%) + 1 pixel.
    But we have to add 1 pixel to the x (which is done as a scale)
        = ((42 + 86) / 86) - ((41 + 86) / 86) = 0.01162790697

NOTE: This math only applies for the tiles that are 86x43 pixels
